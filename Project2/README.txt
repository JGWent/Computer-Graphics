I created a scene with 2 chairs and a pyramid table in front of them. 

I started by taking lab 4 where we had to show a chair and setup it up to show 2 chairs and offset them from each other with tranforamtions.
Next I textured both chairs with their own textures.
Lighting was also done in lab 4 so I just duplicated what was done for so both chairs had lighting.
Next I created a third 3D object in the form of a pryamid that I have been using for past labs.
I then applied a transform to flip it upside down and lowered it so it was in front of the two chairs. 
I applied the same texture that is on the left most chair to the pyramid. This upside down pyarmid is acting as a small table to the two chairs. 

I applied user interactivty to the left most chair the user is able to move the chair with W A S D.
W will move the chair up and away from the table.
A will move the chair closer to the right most chair. 
S will move the chair closer to the table. 
D will move the chair away from the table and right most chair. 

There are two lights that shine on the chairs and can be toggled on and off with buttons avaible to the user. 
I was unable to get the lighting to function with the table.
