Description of your implementation of Lab4 Assignment:

I first Created the teapot20 implementation from lecture to use as a base for lab4.
Next I swaped the teapot20.js file for the object.js file that contained the ball chair. I Also adjusted the numVertices and numTriangles to be the correct values for the chair. 
To allow me to now view the chair I scale the eye values up by 2 as well as the projection plan values 
Next I created the functions that would be attached to the buttons that would adjust the lighting and effects on the chair. 
Each function toggled a flag that would either set a value to 0 or leave it as is.
I created the flags in the html file and multiplied them by the R valeus to toggle if they were their respective values or set to 0
Then I created a second light sorce in the same formate as the first but moveing its location in repect to all 3 axis's 
I added the second lights R values to the first light to simulate both lights being present then tested the functionality of the buttons toggling each ones feature. 
For the shading I did Gouraud shading

My Submission is Case 2
